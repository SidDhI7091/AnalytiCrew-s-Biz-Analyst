AnalytiCrew 🚀

AI-Powered Requirement Documentation System
Built for Barclays Hack-o-Hire by Team AnalytiCrew (Cummins College of Engineering for Women, Pune)

📌 Problem Statement

Requirement gathering and engineering remain one of the most critical yet time-intensive processes in software development. Current challenges include:

Inconsistencies, ambiguities, and inefficiencies in requirement documentation.

No standardized or automated approach → incomplete, redundant, or conflicting requirements.

High manual effort from project managers, analysts, and stakeholders.

Dispersed and unstructured documents → missing critical information.

💡 Our Solution — AnalytiCrew

AnalytiCrew is an AI-powered system that automates requirement extraction, gap analysis, prioritization, and document generation.

✨ Key Highlights:

Extracts functional & non-functional requirements from PDFs, Word, Excel, MOMs, BPMN diagrams, emails, and web pages.

Uses NLP + OCR + AI models for structured extraction & classification.

Performs gap analysis to detect missing, ambiguous, or conflicting requirements.

Auto-generates requirement diagrams, Jira backlog stories, and standardized documents.

Supports real-time chatbot-based collaboration.

Ensures version control, audit logs, and concurrency for multi-user projects.

⚙️ Features

✅ Document Parsing & Requirement Extraction (OCR, NLP, NER)
✅ AI-Powered Gap Analysis with auto-suggestions & conflict detection
✅ Requirement Prioritization (RICE Scoring + MoSCoW)
✅ Auto-Generated Diagrams (UML, Flowcharts, System Architecture)
✅ Standardized Document Generator (Word, Excel, PDF, JSON)
✅ Version Control & Audit System (Rollback, Change Logs, RBAC)
✅ AI Chatbot for Real-Time Clarifications

🏗️ System Workflow

Upload documents → PDFs, Word, Excel, MOM, diagrams, etc.
